# **GA4 Ecommerce Conversion & Revenue Analysis**
## **Data Analyst Case Study using BigQuery (SQL)**

---

## **Overview**

This case study analyzes ecommerce user behavior using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) event-level data queried in Google BigQuery.

The objective of this analysis was to understand why strong website traffic and user engagement were not converting into proportional revenue, and to identify where users were dropping off in the ecommerce journey.

The project focuses on working directly with raw GA4 event data using SQL to uncover conversion gaps, revenue drivers, and user behavior patterns that impact business performance.

## **Business Context**

The ecommerce platform receives a high volume of traffic and shows strong engagement signals such as page views, session starts, and product views. Users actively browse products and interact with the site.

Despite this activity:
- Purchase events remain low
- Revenue growth is limited
- Most users do not return after their first visit

Marketing efforts continue, but stakeholders lack clarity on where the conversion funnel breaks and which areas should be prioritized to improve revenue outcomes.
